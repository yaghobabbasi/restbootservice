# Java Developers online test
We want to develop a RESTful service which sells a product called "some" and this test is covering two positions "junior" and "mid-level" developer. Take a look at the project structure then done the desired tasks based on the position you are deserved.

### Java junior developer
- add service and controller packages
- add CRUD operations for the "Some" class (which is included at com.test) in your controller
- write restful end to end test for your RESTful service

don't forget these
- you don't need Database for your test

### Java mid-level developer
- add service and controller and repository packages
- add CRUD operations for the Some class (which is included at com.test)
- write restful end to end test for your controller

don't forget these
- use an in-memory database for your tests
- remove critical data like the password from your model "Some" when you make a response for the client
- consider security matters about the data you put on DB
